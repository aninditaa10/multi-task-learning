# Sentence Transformers and Multi-Task Learning

This repository contains an implementation of a multi-task learning (MTL) model built on top of the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` SentenceTransformer. It is designed to handle two NLP tasks simultaneously:

- **Task A:** Sentence / Topic Classification (e.g., Topic categorization)
- **Task B:** Sentiment Analysis (Positive / Neutral / Negative)

This code is containerized using Docker and tested in GitHub Codespaces.

---

## Â Project Highlights

- ðŸ”— **Shared Transformer Encoder**: Utilizes `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` for generating sentence embeddings.
- ðŸ”€ **Task-Specific Heads**: Two independent classification heads for Task A and Task B.
- ðŸ§  **Transfer Learning Ready**: Freezes base layers (0 to 3), fine-tunes task heads, final and final-1 layers (i.e. 4 and 5).
